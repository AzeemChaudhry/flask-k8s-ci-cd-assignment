# .github/workflows/ci.yml
# ---------------------------
# CI workflow that:
# - triggers on any push and on pull requests
# - sets up Python
# - installs dependencies from requirements.txt
# - runs flake8 lint (enforcing max-line-length=90 via .flake8)
# - runs pytest unit tests
# - builds a Docker image (for verification; does NOT push)
# ---------------------------

name: CI Pipeline

# Run on pushes to any branch and on PRs targeting any branch
on:
  push:
    branches: ['**']    # trigger on pushes to any branch
  pull_request:
    branches: ['**']    # trigger for PRs

jobs:
  test-and-build:
    # Use a linux runner with Docker available
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: checkout repository
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Python environment
      - name: Set up Python 3.10
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'

      # Step 3: Cache pip packages for speed (keyed by requirements.txt hash)

        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          # Install everything from requirements.txt (includes pytest and flake8)
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      # Step 5: Lint code with flake8 (enforces max-line-length via .flake8)
      - name: Run flake8 lint
        run: |
          echo "Running flake8..."
          # Exit non-zero on lint violations so CI fails the job
          flake8 .

      # Step 6: Run unit tests with pytest
      - name: Run pytest
        run: |
          echo "Running pytest..."
          pytest -q

      # Step 7: Build Docker image (for verification only; no push)
      - name: Build Docker image (local)
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v4
        with:
          context: .
